        Doyle was born on 22 May 1859 at 11 Picardy Place, Edinburgh,
        Scotland. His father, Charles Altamont Doyle, was born in England,
        of Irish Catholic descent, and his mother, Mary (n√©e Foley), was Irish
        Catholic. His parents married in 1855 In 1864 the family scattered
        because of Charles's growing alcoholism, and the children were
        temporarily housed across Edinburgh. Arthur lodged with Mary Burton, the
        aunt of a friend, at Liberton Bank House on Gilmerton Road, while
        studying at Newington Academy In 1867, the family came together
        again and lived in squalid tenement flats at 3 Sciennes Place
        Doyle's father died in 1893, in the Crichton Royal, Dumfries, after many
        years of psychiatric illness. Beginning at an early age,
        throughout his life Doyle wrote letters to his mother, and many of them
        were preserved.
