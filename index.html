        Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ DL (22 May 1859 â€“ 7 July 1930) was
        a British writer and physician. He created the character Sherlock Holmes
        in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six
        short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes stories
        are milestones in the field of crime fiction. Doyle was a prolific
        writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science
        fiction stories about Professor Challenger, and humorous stories about
        the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances,
        poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short
        stories, "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement" (1884), helped to popularise
        the mystery of the Mary Celeste.
